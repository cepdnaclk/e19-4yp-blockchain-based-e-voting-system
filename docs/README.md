### Abstract 

This project explores the development of a **secure, transparent, and verifiable blockchain-based electronic voting (e-voting) system** aimed at addressing the challenges of traditional paper-based and centralized electronic voting systems. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures **ballot secrecy, voter verifiability, contestability, and auditability**, making elections more secure and resistant to tampering.  

The research involves a **comprehensive analysis of existing e-voting systems**, expert interviews with blockchain and cybersecurity professionals, and case study evaluations to identify potential improvements. A prototype of the e-voting system will be developed and tested with a controlled user group to assess **usability, security, and scalability**.  


#### Key Objectives  

✅ **Enhancing security** by preventing fraud and unauthorized modifications to votes  
✅ **Ensuring transparency** through a decentralized and immutable ledger  
✅ **Providing voter verifiability** without compromising ballot secrecy  
✅ **Analyzing usability and accessibility** through user feedback and expert reviews  

Through this research, we aim to contribute to the **future of digital democracy** by demonstrating the feasibility of blockchain-based e-voting systems while addressing potential challenges and limitations.
